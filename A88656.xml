            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>For the exploit of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurrection, they had the a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtance of their fellow-<hi>≈øhe-di≈øciples,</hi> night hou≈øe-wives too, for they were hovering about the <hi>Sepulchre</hi> from the dead of the night till the morning, and were as the <hi>Counter-watch</hi> to give notice of ≈øome advantage to the <hi>Di≈øciples,</hi> who lay not far off, ≈øome where above ground, while their ma≈øter was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.

            </p>
            <p>But when their <hi>Ma≈øter</hi> was pa≈øt all recovery, then each pa≈ø≈øion plaid his part to hinder all humour from comming to <hi>Mount Calvary.</hi> Their ≈øorrow contracts, and clo≈øeth them up in <hi>Jeru≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem: Sorrow</hi> loves to be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and lurk in a corner. <hi>Fear</hi> kept them within doors: <hi>Fear</hi> dare not go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, e≈øpecially in the night, if ≈øhe do, it is to flie a danger, not to invite it.

To ≈øay then they came by night, makes it but the more unlikely. They could not watch one hour with him in <hi>Geth≈øemane</hi> when it concerned his life, while there was yet hope to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate him from the Cro≈øs; and can they now watch with him a whole night when he was dead and buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? If they were for a nights exploit, they would have done it the night before, when there was a fairer op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuuity, and greater ≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. They now had no more means this night, but
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170539:17"/>more danger. When they they went to <hi>Geth≈øemane,</hi> they had but two Swords in all, and were there di≈øarmed of them; but one coat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peece, and ≈øome ≈øtript of that; no weapon to a≈ø≈øault, nor armour to defend. Fit furniture, and fair voyage for poor <hi>Fi≈øhermen</hi> to make to <hi>Mount Calvary</hi> in a dark night, to affront the <hi>Roman</hi> Watch. And to what end? if their Ma≈øter could ri≈øe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, what need they come hither? if not, they did him no wrong to abandon him.</p>
            <p>But why mention we the <hi>Re≈øurrection?</hi> they came not thither, not to a thought of it. He had indeed fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170539:18"/>them of it, but they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtood it not: they could not pro≈øecute what they never apprehended; could they hope to make others believe what they could not imagine? Could others grant that feareable, which they e≈øteemed impo≈ø≈øible? or had they once belief, yet they for≈øook it when they for≈øook their <hi>Ma≈øter.</hi> They were beaten from it in <hi>Geth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øemane,</hi> where but one of the <hi>Jews</hi> received any lo≈ø≈øe, and he but of one of his <hi>eares,</hi> and that re≈øtored again; but they all lo≈øt every one his faith, they lo≈øt their <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> and their <hi>Souls</hi> to boot.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170539:18"/>faithle≈øs in their Ma≈øter as he was to him. The Re≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection quite forgot, not onely the thing it ≈øelf, but their Ma≈øters mention of it: and therefore they embalm his dead body, and do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombe it as forlorn. The <hi>Priests</hi> them≈øelves believed more then the <hi>Di≈øciples:</hi> they feared it, and therefore fortified the <hi>Sepulcher;</hi> but the <hi>Di≈øciples</hi> did not ≈øo much as hope.

La≈øtly, the parties were corrupted, hired with a large ≈øumme to utter their ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at the twelfth ver≈øe.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170539:42"/>and all humane ≈øocieties. So all our A≈ø≈øemblies are grounded upon want, ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to give thanks that the pa≈øt hath been ≈øupplied, but commonly to ≈øupply the wants pre≈øent. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon is, that when a Plurality of Agents are united in their efficacy, the operation is farre more effectual then if each wrought ≈øingle: and what the ≈øingle members cannot obtain apart, they may acquire joyntly, being incorporate into one body. This al≈øo is the ca≈øe of Chri≈øts Di≈øciples, the want of their Ma≈øter collects and imbodies them in together. They want him twice, once on Mount <hi>Calvary;</hi> there
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170539:42"/>they want his ≈øoul; this ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers them clo≈øe in <hi>Jeru≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> and the door is ≈øhut on them, but the place not ≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</p>
               <p>The ≈øecond time he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øakes them on Mount <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet,</hi> at the 9th ver≈øe of the former Chapter, then they want his per≈øon: that puts them together again at the 13th ver≈øe, in the upper room; there they con≈øider of another want, meanes to perform their Mini≈øtry. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> the Traitor hath hang'd him≈øelf, at the 18th ver≈øe, his Bi≈øhoprick is voyd, and they will choo≈øe another in his room, at the 22th ver≈øe; there they prick two, then
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170539:43"/>pray and draw lots; and at the la≈øt ver≈øe <hi>Matthias</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and con≈øecrated. All this being fini≈øhed, they yet find another want, variety of Languages to utter their Emba≈ø≈øie to ≈øeveral Nations, where they were to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. For this there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other meeting upon a ≈øet day, the fifth from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurrection, and the tenth from the A≈øcen≈øion; and then, as it is in my Text, <hi>They were all with one accord in one place.</hi>

               <p>The Expo≈øitors run much <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> about the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons of the≈øe <hi>all,</hi> whether therein the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and other Women were inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: But for the mo≈øt, they

The rea≈øon of this conjecture is, though the Women otherwi≈øe might receive many gifts and graces, yet they were not fit ve≈ø≈øels to be filled with the holy Gho≈øt in this kind, to ≈øpeak with divers tongues. The ≈øub-rea≈øon is, they might not exerci≈øe the functions for which the≈øe Tongues were ordained; they were for <hi>prophecying in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170539:44"/>the Church,</hi> from which St. <hi>Paul</hi> debarres the Women, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24. <hi>Let your Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men keep ≈øilence in the Church, for it is not permitted unto them to ≈øpeak.</hi> Let us not be thought over-weening for ca≈øting now and then a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture diver≈øe from the common current.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170539:45"/>will not: they are ordered in this <hi>(all;)</hi> for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtory-Cardinalls will be in no order; for they make the Canons hold, that the Clau≈øe, <hi>All manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons,</hi> doth not include a Cardinall.</p>
               <p>The number is univer≈øal; not collective, but repre≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative for the whole primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, who was <hi>all</hi> there, not in their own ≈øingle, but in the per≈øons of the≈øe <hi>(all:)</hi> who were there for the acceptation of the holy Gho≈øt, according to the gracious promi≈øes of our Saviour; or haply, all relatively too, the number ≈øpecified in the A≈ø≈øembly
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170539:45"/>for the election of <hi>Matthias.</hi> The total ≈øum of that <hi>all</hi> was about 120. at the 15. ver≈øe of the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: the major part was the 12. Apo≈øtles. 12. the major part of 120. not in <hi>number,</hi> but in <hi>power,</hi> and therefore the better part; though ≈øome think otherwi≈øe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon infer, that every ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary man is as good as a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhop. The number here is 12. not un≈øignificant: the 12. Di≈øciples an≈øwering the 12. Patriarchs; for ≈øo it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed God, that both the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtaments, the new and old, ≈øhould be founded upon <hi>dodecadies;</hi> as the Church of the Jews under the Law

               </p>
               <p>The Fathers and after-Divines, both ancient and modern, do much de≈øcant upon the number of the 12. Apo≈øtles, in relation to the 12. Fountains in <hi>Elim,</hi> and 12.

Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites that carried the Ark, the 12. ≈øpies ≈øent to ≈øearch the Land of promi≈øe, the 12. gates of <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> the 12.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170539:46"/>more the like; ≈øome whereof are pious, others but fancies. Yet in each they frame out a re≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, as ye may ≈øee at large in <hi>Palmeron,</hi> and divers others. With the twelve A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtles the re≈øt of the Di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples made up one hundred and twenty.</p>
               <p>Hereon St. <hi>Au≈øtine</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls in his one hundred and ≈øixteenth Sermon <hi>de Temp.</hi> that the holy Gho≈øt was given ten-fold to the twelve Apo≈øtles, becau≈øe that ten multipiled by twelve makes up the product one hundred and twenty. But the morall of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> in his 35. Moral, and 3d Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170539:47"/>is too my≈øtical, if not meerly <hi>Pythagorical:</hi> he would have 120. partly to ≈øignifie things temporall, partly eternal, by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction; an hundred and twenty by Arithmeticall progre≈ø≈øe ari≈øeth from one to fifteen; and becau≈øe the components are ≈øeven and eight, things temporal are conceived by ≈øeven, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall by eight: of this I conceive not the ground, nor find it approved in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetick. If thus to break numbers were rational, a man might deduce 600. my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteries from the number 120. St. <hi>Jerome</hi> prefigures this number in the age of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170539:47"/>
                  <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> who≈øe years were full one hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. With mode≈øty be it ≈øpoken, St. <hi>Jerome</hi> might have pretyped it by the age of man in general, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. when God ≈øaith of man, that his <hi>years ≈øhall be one hundred and twenty.</hi> Then put <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> together, and the r√©≈øemblance will be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall: <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> a type of <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> the Scriptures both ≈øay and ≈øhew it.</p>
               <p>As the Law de≈øcended fir≈øt from God upon <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> alone, and after him to the people; ≈øo the de≈øcent of the holy Gho≈øt, fir≈øt from God upon Chri≈øt alone, and after from Chri≈øt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the Di≈øciples, who≈øe

Their affections, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were irregular, and ca≈øt on infirmities, as Ambition, Incredulity, Apo≈øta≈øie, were now rectified and directed to their right object. It

This <hi>accord</hi> had God to its efficient; for as God onely makes the heart, ≈øo he onely ≈øea≈øons it, and gives it grace. It had God for its author, and God for its end, and therefore brings to <hi>one place;</hi> which is my third circum≈øtance.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>In the ≈øame place;</hi> Not the ≈øame place numerically, but relatively, in the ≈øame room. This place was a high place; it was an <hi>upper room</hi> and comely. We ≈øhould do all religious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øes in a decent place; the paring away of <hi>ceremonies</hi> do but take away the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ornaments.</hi> Then it was a <hi>high room:</hi> at all ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual exerci≈øes we ≈øhould a≈øcend. Now it is called in Latine <hi>Coenaculum,</hi> a room to ≈øupp in: All reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious exerci≈øes ≈øhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun with the <hi>Supper of the Lord;</hi> and that mu≈øt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon too, not for one only: this room (≈øome ≈øay) was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170539:52"/>to <hi>Nicodemus;</hi> yet this proves not for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles:</hi> for if we have the like authority, we will relea≈øe our Canon. What if we ≈øay, this is <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Porch? for there were ≈øix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcore per≈øons, and it was noi≈øed about by and by, yea by nine of the clock <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was in his Sermon: This therefore is like not to be in a private chamber: but were not this, yet the other was, <hi>ver≈øe</hi> 46.</p>
               <p>God would have them joyn together to receive the Holy Gho≈øt; for where the hearts are together it is much, but where they are
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170539:52"/>together, and their body in one place, there is all the good place can afford. Thus we came from the plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the unanimity, and from the unanimity to the unipre≈øence; the fir≈øt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ≈øecond is but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øed, and the ≈øecond with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the third is but ≈øingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but the≈øe altogether make a complete Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>And now for application of what hath been ≈øaid to our Parliament; In the Di≈øciples a ≈øpiritual want was the cau≈øe of their a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembly, in the Parliament a temporal want. The
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170539:53"/>event in the one was good; God grant it be ≈øo in the other. The time of that was after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurrection, and ≈øo is it of this. The per≈øons are all alike, <hi>Men</hi> all, no <hi>women,</hi> they are too talkative. The number alike, <hi>tho≈øe,</hi> all the <hi>Primitive Church; the≈øe,</hi> all the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi> Of them both our opinions are alike; the one we honour, and the other too, a true Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers. They were una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous and unipre≈øent, and ≈øo al≈øo is the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they had one Coun≈øel, ≈øo have we; their <hi>accord</hi> was good,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170539:53"/>and ≈øo is ours; perfect, to cut off all bad <hi>accord.</hi> Their <hi>accord</hi> re≈øolves a ≈øpiritual welfare, and ≈øo is our accord, to maintain our ≈øelves by warre. So of the≈øe our opinions are alike; the one would be without warre, were they not provoked thereto, but now 'tis needful: ≈øo is our warre al≈øo. That was an upper room, high and ≈øtately, ≈øo is the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament; that was in the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs of <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> this of <hi>London.</hi> Now let us prai≈øe God for them, and pray for them, that there be not oppo≈øition between them. Let the <hi>King</hi> be
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170539:54"/>the <hi>Head,</hi> they the <hi>Heart,</hi> we the <hi>Members.</hi> Let it be like the Parliament in <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> the King and ≈øubjects as <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes,</hi> and we like the <hi>I≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites.</hi> Let God ≈øay to the King, that he will <hi>help him,</hi> and <hi>de≈øtroy his enemies:</hi> Let the King ≈øay to the people as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> to the <hi>Gibeonites;</hi> and let the people ≈øay to him as <hi>I≈ørael</hi> to <hi>David, We will ≈øerve and obey thee onely, and do what thou commande≈øt us:</hi> and let me pray for them, that they may ≈øtand fa≈øt in the Faith: and let's all ≈øay of them all that be
